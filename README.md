# FozenLake

Finding policies for the frozen lake environment using reinforcement learning algorithms

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the FozenLake up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 
- numpy

### File Structure

- EnvironmentModel.py
  Contains premistive instruction for a game environemnt

- Environment.py
  a wrapper for the environment mode

- FrozenLake.py
  a controller for the Frozen Lake game that inherits the Environment Class

- game.py
  - main functino that initial the FrozenLake game and call the available agents
  - Policy Iteration Implementation
  - Value Iteration Implementation
  - Sarsa Implementation
  - Q-Learning Implementation
  - Linear Sarsa Implementation
  - Linear Q-Learning Implementation

## Running the tests

In order to run the program run the following command:

```
python game.py
```

The above will run all the algorithims in the `main` function in `game.py`
